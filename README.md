The  RISC-V Talent Development Program , powered by  Samsung Semiconductor India Research (SSIR)  and  VLSI System Design (VSD) , is focused on nurturing talent in the RISC-V ecosystem. As a participant, I, Lalu Prasad B, from  Sahyadri College of Engineering & Management, Mangaluru  (email: lalu.ec22@sahyadri.edu.in), undertook Task 1, which involved setting up a virtual development environment, writing a parameterized C program, and cross-compiling it for the RISC-V architecture. Using VirtualBox, I successfully set up a virtual machine running Ubuntu 18.04 by creating a new instance, allocating resources, and booting it with a pre-configured VDI file. 

I then wrote a C program (`sum1ton.c`) to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to \( n \) using a loop and compiled it locally using the GCC compiler. The program was executed successfully, with the input value \( n \) provided during runtime. The programâ€™s functionality was validated by testing with various inputs. Subsequently, I targeted the same program for the RISC-V architecture by using the  RISC-V GCC cross-compiler  (`riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc`) with optimization flags such as `-O1` and `-Ofast`, and architecture-specific parameters like `-mabi=lp64` and `-march=rv64i`. This process generated an optimized object file (`sum1ton.o`) that can run on a RISC-V simulation or hardware. This task helped me understand the workflow of developing, compiling, and optimizing code for specific hardware architectures, highlighting the importance of cross-compilation and optimization in embedded system development.
